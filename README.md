# Publication Abstract
1. The study applied an analytical method, PageRank, to rank the licensed real estate agents based upon the real estate offers where the agent represents a seller or a buyer of a residential real estate property, and the offers resulted in the property sales with the corresponding parties. We analyzed the resulting ranking by studying patterns and common characteristics for agents with high and low scores. Our dataset is based on the listing data obtained from Miami Association of Realtors. The study used Python programming for data pre-processing and algorithmic ranking.
